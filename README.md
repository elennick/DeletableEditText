# androidwidget

Gives a DeletableEditText widget for Android apps. This field is identical to a normal EditText except it provides a (x) 
clear button on the right side of the component that users can tap to instantly clear the field.

The size of the clear button is configurable using setButtonSize(DeletableEditText.SIZE);

This component provides two additional listeners via the DeletableEditText.OnTextClearedListener interface to listen for clear events.
